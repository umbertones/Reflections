How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   The differences were clearly marked

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    you could easily go back to an earlier version when you went in the wrong direction
    Code reuse is easy

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Automatically creates a lot of garbage versions, but you'll never miss a necessary commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It easier to reorder the package when you have everything separate, but it makes you more workload/documentation

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	Git log shows the ids of the commits and git diff compares two chosen commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You could easily revert to an earlier version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Use it in my next course for revision control
