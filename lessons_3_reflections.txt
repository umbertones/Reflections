When would you want to create a remote repository?

	When there is stuff ready to share with other people.
	To keep a backup of my work


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There would be a lot of unfinished or useless commits in the cloud
